  const prompt = `The user wants two different 30-second video scripts for a kids' story.
Each script should be just the story text, without scene descriptions or anything in braces.
The final output must be a JSON object following the specified schema.

**Script 1 Idea:** A simple story about a lost kitten finding its way home.
**Script 2 Idea:** A story about a little star who learns to shine brightly.

**Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**
1. Two different scripts? Yes.
2. 30 seconds video length? Yes, I'll aim for roughly 75-90 words per script, which is a good estimate for 30 seconds of narration.
3. Topic: Kids Story? Yes.
4. No Scene description? Yes.
5. No Braces? Yes.
6. Plain story text only? Yes.
7. JSON Format? Yes.
8. Follow Schema? Yes.

Confidence Score: 5/5


Both drafts seem suitable. They are simple, positive, fit the time constraint, and adhere to all negative constraints. I will now format them according to the JSON schema.

Generate image prompts in ${videoStyle} style for each scene of a 30-second video based on this script:

"${script}"

Instructions:
- Just give specifying image prompts based on the storyline.
- Do not include camera angles.
- Return a JSON array (Max 4-5 items) in the following format:

[
  {
    "imagePrompt": "<detailed image prompt>",
    "sceneContent": "<script segment>"
  }
]

Constraints:
- Ensure each image prompt is richly descriptive and directly tied to one scene.
- Follow the intended style: ${videoStyle}.
