# So in prisma i understand that 

There we are creating 2 ids one is the user.id and another is the clerkUserId 
So as we now every user need a clerkUserId so we are updating that also and


# 1. id in the User model
This is the unique identifier for each user in your database.

It's like a name tag or ID card that says, "This is user #123."

It is generated by your database automatically (@default(uuid())).

It helps your system know exactly who each user is.


# 2. id in the Assessment model
This is the unique identifier for each assessment (test or quiz).

It tells your system, "This is assessment #abc."

This ID is also automatically generated (@default(cuid())).

It helps keep every assessment record separate and easy to find.


# 3. userId in the Assessment model
This is a special ID that links an assessment to a user.

It stores the id of the user who took the assessment.


## 

user: This is the name of the field inside Assessment that represents the connected User object.

You can think of it like a property you can use in your code to get the full user details for an assessment.

# User: The type of this field — it points to the User model.
@relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]):

# fields: [userId]: This tells Prisma,
"In this model (Assessment), the userId field is the foreign key that stores the user’s ID."

# references: [id]: This tells Prisma,
"The userId field references the id field in the User model."
