# So in prisma i understand that

There we are creating 2 ids one is the user.id and another is the clerkUserId
So as we now every user need a clerkUserId so we are updating that also and

# 1. id in the User model

This is the unique identifier for each user in your database.

It's like a name tag or ID card that says, "This is user #123."

It is generated by your database automatically (@default(uuid())).

It helps your system know exactly who each user is.

# 2. id in the Assessment model

This is the unique identifier for each assessment (test or quiz).

It tells your system, "This is assessment #abc."

This ID is also automatically generated (@default(cuid())).

It helps keep every assessment record separate and easy to find.

# 3. userId in the Assessment model

This is a special ID that links an assessment to a user.

It stores the id of the user who took the assessment.

##

user: This is the name of the field inside Assessment that represents the connected User object.

You can think of it like a property you can use in your code to get the full user details for an assessment.

# User: The type of this field — it points to the User model.

@relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]):

# fields: [userId]: This tells Prisma,

"In this model (Assessment), the userId field is the foreign key that stores the user’s ID."

# references: [id]: This tells Prisma,

"The userId field references the id field in the User model."

## react-hook-form || zod || @hookform/resolvers

# zod :

        Zod is a library that lets you define schemas (data shapes) and validate data against those schemas. It works well with TypeScript,
        providing both runtime validation and type inference.

# useForm :

        useForm is a hook provided by popular form libraries like React Hook Form. It's used to manage form state, validation, and submission in React applications.

# {...register("experience")}: Registers the field with React Hook Form using the register function.

# It links this field to the form's validation and state handling.


# Destructured values from useForm:
      register: Used to register input fields and link them to the form state/validation.
      handleSubmit: Used to handle form submission (onSubmit), triggering validation.
      formState.errors: Contains validation error messages for each field.
      setValue: Allows you to programmatically set the value of a form field.
      watch: Allows you to watch the value of one or more fields in real-time.


# So we need to called the update user after submit the form for that we already created that but we can't called it directly because they are not a server component
For that we are creating a hooks in that use-fetch.js in that we fetch data and run the updateuser function and that use in the onboarding-form

So we need to understand this that we create a hook that use to fetch and run data by using action/user.js we need to run the updatedUser so for that we create this hook and now we are using useFetch in the client component
